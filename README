Email classification:

Build a model to classify direct vs. general email addresses.

Approach:

1. Load and read the .csv file containing emails
2. Define a list with words that general emails usually use -> general_words_list
3. Define a empty list for saving the result (match) -> general_emails
4. Define a empty list for saving the result (match) -> personal_emails
5. Write a algorithm:
    Iterate through every row in csv file
    Save row in get_email_lower
    Iterate through general_words_list
    Compare if get_email_lower in general_words_list
        If true add the email to general_emails
        Else, add the email to personal_emails
6.Save the results in a csv output file ‘classified_emails.csv’


Future work:

Write a API to find the urls of emails located on the Internet
